## Cost analysis:
This approach aims to keep expenses low while still delivering a functional and effective "Disease Detection from Blood Report" system. Here's a breakdown of the potential costs involved:

### <b>Hardware:</b>
Since the project focuses on software development, the team can use their existing computers or university-provided resources. Therefore, there should be no additional hardware costs.

### <b>Software:</b>
* Programming Language: As mentioned earlier, Python is a popular and free programming language. So, there won't be any costs associated with language usage.
* Machine Learning Frameworks: Popular frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn are open-source and freely available. The team can leverage these without any additional expenses.
* Data Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn, commonly used for data visualization in Python, are also open-source and free to use.

### <b>Data Collection:</b>
To minimize costs, the team can search for publicly available and open-access datasets related to blood reports and disease cases. This will eliminate the need for purchasing expensive datasets or collecting data through costly means.

### <b>Version Control:</b>
The team can use Git, a free and open-source version control system, to manage the project's codebase and collaborate efficiently.

### <b>User Interface: </b>
For the user interface, JavaScript, Kotlin and Flutter can be used, and these technologies are freely available. The team can design a basic, functional interface without incurring additional expenses.

### <b>Deployment Platform:</b>
* Local Deployment: Local deployment on individual machines or a local network is cost-effective as it doesn't require external hosting or server fees.
* Cloud-Based Deployment: While cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP offer scalability and convenience, they may come with costs for computing resources. To keep costs low, the team can opt for free-tier plans offered by some cloud providers, which typically include a limited amount of resources at no cost.

### <b>Documentation:</b>
Documentation can be created using free tools like Google Docs or Microsoft Office Online.

### <b>Miscellaneous Costs: </b>
There might be minor miscellaneous costs like internet connectivity and transportation, but these are typically negligible in a university or educational setting.<br>

It's important to note that while minimizing costs is essential, the team should also consider the trade-offs between cost and project requirements. If specific features or resources are necessary for the project's success, they may need to allocate a budget for those aspects. Additionally, open-source tools often have active communities and extensive documentation, making it easier for the team to find support and resources during development.<br>

Overall, by strategically selecting open-source tools and making use of freely available resources, the project can be completed with a minimum cost, showcasing the team's ability to develop an impactful solution within budget constraints.

## <b>Existing Alternatives:</b>
Currently, disease detection from blood reports is predominantly performed manually by medical professionals, such as doctors and laboratory technicians. They analyze the blood test results, interpret the findings, and make diagnostic decisions based on their expertise. While this approach has been the standard practice for years, it has certain limitations:
* Subjectivity: Manual analysis is subjective and can vary depending on the individual's experience and expertise. Different professionals may interpret the same blood report differently, leading to inconsistent results.
* Time-Consuming: Manual analysis is time-consuming, especially in busy healthcare settings, where medical professionals have to handle a large number of patients.
* Human Error: Manual analysis is prone to human errors, which can result in misdiagnosis or delayed detection of diseases.
* Limited Scale: Manual analysis restricts the scale at which disease detection can be performed. As the number of patients increases, it becomes challenging for healthcare professionals to handle the workload efficiently.

While some advanced laboratories may use computer-assisted tools for specific blood tests, comprehensive and automated disease detection systems are relatively limited in the current healthcare landscape. Therefore, the project aims to improve the existing state of disease detection by introducing a software system that addresses these shortcomings and offers the following improvements:

* Automation: The project seeks to automate the disease detection process, reducing the dependency on manual analysis and accelerating the diagnostic timeline. This will enable medical professionals to focus on more critical tasks, enhancing overall healthcare efficiency.
* Objectivity: By utilizing machine learning algorithms, the system can provide more objective and consistent results, reducing the chances of human error and improving diagnostic accuracy.
* Speed and Efficiency: The automated system can process blood reports quickly, allowing for timely diagnosis and faster medical interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
